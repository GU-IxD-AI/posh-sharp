    /**
     * Implementation of the agent timer.

     *  The agent timer is responsible for checking drive element call
        frequencies, and for adjusting the loop timing. The time is usually
        initialised at 0 and then each call to C{time} returns the time in
        milliseconds that has passed since initialisation.

     *  Currently, this module provides a stepped timer and a real-time
        timer. The step timer increases its time by 1 every time that
        loopEnd() is called, but does not provide frequency checking and
        neither cares about the loop timing, as it is assumed that the timing
        is controlled from the outside. The real-time timer uses the pc time
        and provides both frequency checking and loop frequency control.
